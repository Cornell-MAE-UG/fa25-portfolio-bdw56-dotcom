## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore student-athlete in Cornell University's Duffield School of Engineering where I also play on the Cornell Men's Varsity Soccer Team. I recently decided to take on a minor in Business and affiliated myself into the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in order to pursue my interests in mathematics and robotics.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
