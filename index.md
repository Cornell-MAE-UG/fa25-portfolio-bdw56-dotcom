My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a student-athelte at Cornell University. Along with being on the varsity soccer team, I plan on affiliaitng myself into the Sibley School of Mechanical Engineering here. 

My dream is to come out of University with a great background and understanding of what my passions in the workfield are along with becoming the best soccer player that I can become in order to continue playing afterwards.
