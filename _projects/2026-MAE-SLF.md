# Your Project Title

**Team:** Buzzkill
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

## Problem statement (most important)

<Who is affected?> is trying to <do what?> in <where/when?>, but <what currently goes wrong?>.
What challenge currently makes obvious solutions difficult to implement?
Add enough detail to narrow down the scope to the part of the problem you want to focus on.  

## Impact
Give context for why solving this sub-problem addresses the client's user needs.

## Proposed direction(s)

### Concept A (primary): <1-line name>

**What it is:** <1–2 sentences.>  
**How it would be used:** <2–4 bullet “user flow” steps.>  
**Why it’s better than the status quo:** <2–3 bullets.>  
**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:** <what you can realistically build/test in MAE 2250.>  

## Key risks / unknowns

- <Risk 1> — why it matters, and how you’ll test it.
- <Risk 2> — why it matters, and how you’ll test it.
- <Risk 3> — why it matters, and how you’ll test it.

## Questions for the client
Focus on questions they can answer from lived experience.
1. **<Question 1>**  
   *Decision affected:* <what choice this answer changes for your team.>
2. **<Question 2>**  
   *Decision affected:* <what choice this answer changes for your team.>
3. **<Question 3>**  
   *Decision affected:* <what choice this answer changes for your team.>
